        months beyond your return date. Keep physical as well as photocopies of
        your passport and visa as well as an identity proof.

        yourself and avoid unforeseen circumstances such as medical emergencies,
        loss of personal belongings or even trip cancellation.

        avoid high roaming charges.

        Download offline maps for better navigation, cab booking apps and even translation
        apps for a convenient journey.
        <br />

        country you are travelling to avoid communication barriers.

        settings.
        <br />

        exchange rates. It is also suggested to carry cash to avoid last minute
        challenges.

        Lastly, get information about local police and other emergency services and share
